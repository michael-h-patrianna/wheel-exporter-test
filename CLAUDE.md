=== CRITICAL INSTRUCTION BLOCK (CIB-001)===

## MANDATORY TOOLS

### For Complex Tasks (research, analysis, debugging)
```
USE: mcp__mcp_docker__sequentialthinking
WHEN: Multi-step problems, research, complex reasoning
WHY: Prevents cognitive overload, ensures systematic approach
```

### For Task Management
```
USE: TodoWrite
WHEN: Any task with 3+ steps
WHY: Tracks progress, maintains focus
```

## MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL
1. Always complete all tasks fully. Do not simplify approaches, do not skip tasks.
2. Always keep tests up to date and maintain 100% test coverage.
3. Always test. 100% of tests must pass.
4. Always fix bugs. Never changes tests only to make them pass if the cause is in the code it is testing.
5. Never run Vitest in watch mode; automation must use `npm test`. Only set `ALLOW_VITEST_WATCH=1` when a human explicitly authorizes interactive debugging.

## FOLDER USAGE RULES

| Activity | Required Directory | Agent Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser automation (Playwright/Puppeteer runners, recorders) | `scripts/playwright/` | Keep every `.js`/`.mjs` harness here. Subfolders allowed, but **never** place these scripts in the repo root. |
|  Analytics utilities | `scripts/tools/` | Import from `../../src` or `../../dist` as needed. No tooling lives in the project root. |
| Visual artifacts (screenshots, videos, GIFs) | `screenshots/` | Always persist captured assets here. Create nested folders like `screenshots/quality-test/` or `screenshots/videos/` to stay organized. |
| Documentation, research notes | `docs/` | Long-form analysis belongs in this directory instead of new markdown files at the root. |
| ðŸš« Forbidden | Project root | Keep root pristineâ€”no scripts, screenshots, or scratch docs. |

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A React/TypeScript application that renders interactive spinning wheel components from ZIP files exported by a Figma plugin. The app extracts wheel data (images, positioning, gradients) and renders fully interactive wheels with animations.

## Commands

### Development
```bash
npm start          # Start dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm test           # Run tests in watch mode
npm run build      # Production build to build/ folder
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **ZIP Extraction** (`src/utils/zipExtractor.ts`): Parses uploaded ZIP containing `positions.json` and image assets, returns `ExtractedAssets`
2. **Main App** (`src/App.tsx`): Manages file upload, dimension controls, component visibility toggles
3. **Wheel Viewer** (`src/components/WheelViewer.tsx`): Core orchestrator - manages component state (header states, spin animation, rotation) and renders all layers
4. **Renderers** (`src/components/renderers/`): Individual components for each wheel layer (background, segments, overlays, spin button)

### Layer System (Z-Order)
Layers render in strict order from back to front:
1. Background image
2. Wheel background overlay
3. Segments (generated SVG with gradients)
4. Header (3 states: active/success/fail)
5. Wheel top layer 1
6. Wheel top layer 2
7. Spin button (2 states: default/spinning)
8. Center overlay (optional debug circle)
9. Gradient handles (debug visualization)

### Type System (`src/types.ts`)
- **WheelExport**: Complete wheel definition from positions.json
- **ExtractedAssets**: ZIP contents with blob URLs
- **Fill/Gradient**: Complex gradient system supporting linear/radial/angular/diamond with handles
- **ComponentState**: HeaderState (active/success/fail), ButtonSpinState (default/spinning)

### Coordinate Systems
- **Original frame**: Absolute pixel coordinates from Figma export
- **Scaling**: Uniform scale applied to maintain aspect ratio (`scale = min(targetWidth/frameWidth, targetHeight/frameHeight)`)
- **Center-based positioning**: Wheel elements use (x, y) as center point
- **Bounding box**: Background/header use top-left (x, y) + width/height

### Gradient Rendering (`src/utils/segmentUtils.tsx`)
- Handles contain normalized positions (0-1) in segment bounding box
- Linear gradients: handle[1] is start (0%), handle[0] is end (100%) - handles are swapped to fix 180Â° reversal
- Radial gradients: handle[0] is center, handle[1] defines radius
- Segments use `objectBoundingBox` coordinate space
- Gradients remain consistent across all segments regardless of rotation

### Animation System
Spin animation (`WheelViewer.tsx:handleSpin`):
1. Calculate target segment and angle
2. Add 5-7 full rotations + overshoot (15-25Â°)
3. 5s main spin with cubic-bezier easing
4. 1.5s bounce-back to final position
5. Total: 6.5s animation

## Key Patterns

### State Management
- Component visibility controlled by `componentVisibility` object in App
- Animation state (spinning, rotation) managed in WheelViewer
- Visual state (header/button states) local to WheelViewer

### Segment Generation
Segments dynamically created from:
- `segmentCount` (3-8 segments)
- `WheelSegmentStyles` defining fill/stroke for odd/even/nowin/jackpot kinds
- Alternating pattern: odd/even/odd/even...
- Rendered as SVG paths with gradient fills

### Image Loading
All images from ZIP converted to blob URLs via `URL.createObjectURL()`
Images passed down as props to renderer components

## Important Notes

- Frame dimensions (`wheelData.frameSize`) determine the "original" coordinate space - all positions in positions.json are relative to this
- Gradients use handle positions when available, falling back to rotation angle
- The `center` component defines the circular exclusion zone (not rendered by default)
- Spin button controls wheel rotation via `targetRotation` state
- All renderers are independent React components receiving scale + data props
